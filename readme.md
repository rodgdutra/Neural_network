# Neural Network with python
## To read in portuguese : [Readme em portuguÃªs](https://github.com/rodgdutra/Neural_network/blob/master/readme-pt.md)

This Repository contains several examples of Neural Networks applied in the solution of 2 major use cases, classification and regression focused on time series.

## Neural Network applied from 0
There are a example is this repo applying a Neural Network from 0 using python to do so.
* [classic neural net](https://github.com/rodgdutra/Neural_network/blob/master/classic_neural_net/classic_net.ipynb)

## Classification
The First classification example was applied into a Mammography dataset, to detect the severity of a breast cancer.
* [Breast Cancer classification](https://github.com/rodgdutra/Neural_network/blob/master/mamografy_dataset_example/mamografy_classification.ipynb)

The second example applies several Topologies of classification to compare the best outcome of each structure proposed.

* [Wine classification](https://github.com/rodgdutra/Neural_network/tree/master/wine_dataset_example)

## Time series
There are 2 examples of time series regression analysis in this repository, the first one was applied to a wind velocity database, the second one was applied to the BOVA11 dataset. Both of the applications aim to predict 1 step ahead of the desired variable.
* [Wind prediction](https://github.com/rodgdutra/Neural_network/blob/master/time_series_wind/wind_prediction.ipynb)

* [BOVA11 prediction](https://github.com/rodgdutra/Neural_network/blob/master/time_series_bovespa/ibov_time_series.ipynb)
