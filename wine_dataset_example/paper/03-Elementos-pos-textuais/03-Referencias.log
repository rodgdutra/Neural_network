! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
l.11 Blake, C. &
                 Merz, C. UCI repository of machine learning databases, 1998.
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
